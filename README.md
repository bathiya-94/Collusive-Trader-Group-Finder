# Project  - Collusive Traders
Stock markets facilitate trading of company stocks among market participants (i.e., traders) at an agreed price. Market participants are allowed to submit their buy/sell interests (i.e., orders) to the stock market and the stock market matches these buy/sell orders based on their interested buying/selling price (simplest scenario). The given Trades.csv file contains a set of trades done by multiple traders on multiple stocks in a stock market.
1. Use suitable unsupervised learning techniques with necessary justifications to identify both outlier trades (i.e., traded quantities) and traders in one selected stock in the given dataset.
2. Also explain and implement an approach that can be used to identify collusive trader groups in the full dataset.

This  project was carried  out in fullfillng the requirements of the module EE7205 - Machine Learning , Faculty of Enginnering , University of Ruhuna. A complete  report of the project can be found in the PDF file
