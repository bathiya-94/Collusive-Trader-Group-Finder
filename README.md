# Project  - Collusive Traders
Stock markets facilitate trading of company stocks among market participants (i.e., traders) at an agreed price. Market participants are allowed to submit their buy/sell interests (i.e., orders) to the stock market and the stock market matches these buy/sell orders based on their interested buying/selling price (simplest scenario). The given Trades.csv file contains a set of trades done by multiple traders on multiple stocks in a stock market.
> Use suitable unsupervised learning techniques with necessary justifications to identify both outlier trades (i.e., traded quantities) and traders in one selected stock in the given dataset.
> Also explain and implement an approach that can be used to identify collusive trader groups in the full dataset.
